      {
        "questionText": "Your analysts repeatedly run the same complex queries that combine and filter through a lot of data on BigQuery. The data changes frequently. You need to reduce the effort for the analysts. What should you do?",
        "options": [
          "A. Export the frequently queried data into Cloud SQL.",
          "B. Export the frequently queried data into a new table.",
          "C. Create a view of the frequently queried data.",
          "D. Create a dataset with the data that is frequently queried."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [2],
        "explanation": "Creating a view will rerun the complex query automatically. Meanwhile, the analysts need only reference the name of the view, which makes it easier for them."

      {
        "questionText": "You have large amounts of data stored on Cloud Storage and BigQuery. Some of it is processed, but some is yet unprocessed. You have a data mesh created in Dataplex.

          "D. The user has no access if IAM denies the permission."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [1],
        "explanation": "IAM and ACLs work in parallel. If either of the systems grants the user access permission, the user will have access."

          "D. Configure a data retention policy on Cloud Storage."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [2],
        "explanation": "A lifecycle policy on Cloud Storage allows you to manage your data automatically as it moves through its lifecycle, moving data to cheaper storage classes as access needs decrease."
