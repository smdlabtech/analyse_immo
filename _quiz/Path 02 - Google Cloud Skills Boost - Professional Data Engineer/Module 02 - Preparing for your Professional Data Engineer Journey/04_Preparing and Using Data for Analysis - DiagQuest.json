    "questions": [
      {
        "questionText": "You repeatedly run the same queries by joining multiple tables. The original tables change about ten times per day. You want an optimized querying approach. Which feature should you use?",
        "options": [
          "A. Partitions",
          "B. Views",
          "C. Materialized views",
          "D. Federated queries"
        ],
        "answerIndex": [2],
        "explanation": "Materialized views will improve query performance by precomputing and periodically caching query results."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "You have a complex set of data that comes from multiple sources. The analysts in your team need to analyze the data, visualize it, and publish reports to internal and external stakeholders. You need to make it easier for the analysts to work with the data by abstracting the multiple data sources. What tool do you recommend?",
        "options": [
          "A. Looker Studio",
          "B. D3.js library",
          "C. Connected Sheets",
          "D. Looker"
        ],
        "answerIndex": [3],
        "explanation": "Looker lets you model the underlying data sources and create an abstraction that analysts can easily build on."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "You built machine learning (ML) models based on your own data. In production, the ML models are not giving satisfactory results. When you examine the data, it appears that the existing data is not sufficiently representing the business goals. You need to create a more accurate machine learning model. What should you do?",
        "options": [
          "A. Train the model with the same data, but use more epochs.",
          "B. Perform feature engineering, and use domain knowledge to enhance the column data.",
          "C. Train the model with more of similar data.",
          "D. Perform L2 regularization."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [1],
        "explanation": "Feature engineering can pick and choose relevant data columns and also enhance a model by combining columns. For this requirement, feature engineering improves the ML model."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "Your company uses Google Workspace and your leadership team is familiar with its business apps and collaboration tools. They want a cost-effective solution that uses their existing knowledge to evaluate, analyze, filter, and visualize data that is stored in BigQuery. What should you do to create a solution for the leadership team?",
        "options": [
          "A. Configure Looker Studio",
          "B. Configure Tableau",
          "C. Create models in Looker",
          "D. Configure Connected Sheets"
        ],
        "answerIndex": [3],
        "explanation": "Connected Sheets is an easy way to integrate BigQuery data with Google Sheets. Because the leadership team is familiar with Workspace and Sheets, this satisfies their requirement."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "You have data in PostgreSQL that was designed to reduce redundancy. You are transferring this data to BigQuery for analytics. The source data is hierarchical and frequently queried together. You need to design a BigQuery schema that is performant. What should you do?",
        "options": [
          "A. Copy the normalized data into partitions.",
          "B. Copy the primary tables and use federated queries for secondary tables.",
          "C. Use nested and repeated fields.",
          "D. Retain the data in normalized form always."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [2],
        "explanation": "Because the data is queried together, the schema design can group the data together with nested and repeated fields."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "You need to optimize the performance of queries in BigQuery. Your tables are not partitioned or clustered. What optimization technique can you use?",
        "options": [
          "A. Perform self-joins on data.",
          "B. Use the LIMIT clause to reduce the data read.",
          "C. Filter data as late as possible.",
          "D. Batch your updates and inserts."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [3],
        "explanation": "Updating and inserting rows one at a time is not performant. Batch them instead."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "Your business has collected industry-relevant data over many years. The processed data is useful for your partners and they are willing to pay for its usage. You need to ensure proper access control over the data. What should you do?",
        "options": [
          "A. Host the data on Cloud SQL.",
          "B. Export the data to persistent disks and share it through an FTP endpoint.",
          "C. Export the data to zip files and share it through Cloud Storage.",
          "D. Host the data on Analytics Hub."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [3],
        "explanation": "Analytics Hub has the built-in options to connect publishers and subscribers with access control and to monetize data access."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "You used Dataplex to create lakes and zones for your business data. However, some files are not being discovered. What could be the issue?",
        "options": [
          "A. You have an exclude pattern that matches the files.",
          "B. You have scheduled discovery to run every hour.",
          "C. The files are in ORC format.",
          "D. The files are in Parquet format."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [0],
        "explanation": "An exclude pattern will skip the file and therefore, this could be the reason the data is not discovered."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "You have analytics data stored in BigQuery. You need an efficient way to compute values across a group of rows and return a single result for each row. What should you do?",
        "options": [
          "A. Use an aggregate function.",
          "B. Use BigQuery ML.",
          "C. Use a UDF (user-defined function).",
          "D. Use a window function with an OVER clause."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [3],
        "explanation": "A window function defines rows around each row. As a result, this approach can produce a separate output for each row."
      },
      {
        "questionText": "Your data in BigQuery has some columns that are extremely sensitive. You need to enable only some users to see certain columns. What should you do?",
        "options": [
          "A. Create a new dataset with the column's data.",
          "B. Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions.",
          "C. Create a new table with the column's data.",
          "D. Use policy tags."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [3],
        "explanation": "In BigQuery, policy tags give you fine-grained column level access control."
