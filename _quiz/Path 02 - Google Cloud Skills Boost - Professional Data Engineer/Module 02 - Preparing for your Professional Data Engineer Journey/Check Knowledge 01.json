        "options": [
          "A. Ensure that the access permissions are given strictly based on the personâ€™s title and job role.",
          "B. Give just enough permissions to get the task done.",

        "answerIndex": [1],
        "explanation": "The Principle of Least Privilege involves providing only the minimal level of permissions required to perform a task, which enhances security by limiting access rights for users to the bare minimum necessary to perform their work."
