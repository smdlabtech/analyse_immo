		"options": [
			"Structured data is less organized and does not adhere to a predefined data model, while unstructured data is highly organized and typically stored in relational databases.",
			"Structured data is highly organized and easily queried with languages such as SQL, while unstructured data does not follow a specific format and is more complex to analyze.",
			"Structured data and unstructured data are the same; the terms can be used interchangeably.",
			"Unstructured data is always text-based, while structured data consists of numbers and dates only."
		],
		"answerIndex": [1],
		"explanation": "Structured data refers to any data that resides in a fixed field within a record or file, like data contained in relational databases and spreadsheets. It's easy to enter, search, and analyze. Unstructured data, on the other hand, is information that either does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner. It's typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This includes emails, videos, photos, web pages, and other forms of unstructured data. The key difference lies in the ease of processing and analysis, with structured data being more straightforward due to its organized nature.",
