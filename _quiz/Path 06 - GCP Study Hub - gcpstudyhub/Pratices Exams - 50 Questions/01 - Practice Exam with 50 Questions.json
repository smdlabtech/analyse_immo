The company's security team requires the ability to have complete control over the encryption keys used to encrypt this data, including the ability to rotate, manage, and revoke access to these keys as needed. Additionally, the team needs to ensure that the encryption keys themselves are securely managed and protected. What approach should the company take in Google Cloud to meet these stringent encryption and key management requirements?",
	  "options": [
		"A. Utilize the default server-side encryption provided by Google Cloud Storage, which automatically encrypts stored data.",
		"B. Implement Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) using Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to maintain control over the encryption keys.",
		"C. Store the encryption keys on-premises and use a dedicated connection to Google Cloud for data encryption and decryption.",
		"D. Use a third-party encryption service to encrypt data before storing it in Google Cloud Storage."
	  ],
	  "answerIndex": [1],
	  "explanation": "Implementing Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) with Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) allows the company to have full control over the encryption keys used for their data in Google Cloud Storage. This approach satisfies the requirement for stringent key management as dictated by industry regulations. With CMEK, the security team can create, manage, rotate, and revoke access to the encryption keys as needed. Google Cloud KMS provides a secure and robust platform for key management, ensuring that the keys themselves are protected. This solution aligns with the need for a high degree of control and security in managing the encryption keys, while also leveraging the scalable and secure infrastructure provided by Google Cloud.",

	  "questionText": "Your company operates an online video streaming service. The service hosts a large and growing library of videos, with varying levels of access frequency. Newly released videos are accessed frequently, but older videos are viewed less over time. The company needs an efficient and cost-effective way to store these videos in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), ensuring that storage costs are optimized based on the access frequency of the videos. What is the most appropriate storage class in GCS to use for this scenario?",
	  "options": [
		"A. Use the Standard Storage class for all buckets containing videos, as it provides the best access speed for frequently and infrequently accessed data.",
		"B. Choose for GCS to automatically detect and change the storage class needed for each bucket based on its access frequency.",
		"C. Utilize the Multi-Regional bucket to ensure high availability and access speed across different regions.",
		"D. Implement a lifecycle management policy to transition videos from Standard to Nearline or Coldline Storage as their access frequency decreases."
	  ],
	  "answerIndex": [3],
	  "explanation": "Implementing a lifecycle management policy in Google Cloud Storage allows for an efficient and cost-effective way to manage the storage of videos based on access frequency. Initially, new videos can be stored in the Standard Storage class to provide high-speed access when they are frequently viewed. As videos age and their access frequency decreases, the lifecycle management policy can automatically transition them to Nearline or Coldline Storage, which are more cost-effective options for less frequently accessed data. This approach optimizes storage costs while ensuring that videos are still accessible when needed. The option of auto-detecting and changing storage classes is not feasible in GCS, as storage classes need to be defined by policies set by the user, not automatically by the system.",

	  "questionText": "Your company is developing a new web application that requires a highly available and scalable caching layer to maintain session state and frequently accessed data. The application experiences variable traffic, with occasional spikes during promotional events. To meet these requirements in Google Cloud, the team is considering using Google Cloud Memorystore. Which Memorystore mode or feature should be implemented to optimize for high availability, scalability, and handling variable traffic loads?",
	  "options": [
		"A. Use Memorystore for Redis in Basic Tier for cost-effective caching with minimal setup.",
		"B. Implement Memorystore for Redis in Standard Tier to ensure high availability and failover protection.",
		"C. Configure Memorystore for Memcached to leverage its auto-discovery feature for scalability.",
		"D. Set up multiple independent Memorystore for Redis instances in Basic Tier and manually manage failover."
	  ],
	  "answerIndex": [1],
	  "explanation": "Implementing Memorystore for Redis in the Standard Tier is the most suitable choice for this scenario. The Standard Tier offers high availability with automatic failover, which is critical for maintaining the session state and frequently accessed data reliably, especially during variable traffic conditions. This tier provides a replicated Redis setup, ensuring that the caching layer remains available even if one of the nodes fails. The Standard Tier's capabilities are well-suited for applications that require a resilient and scalable caching solution to handle traffic spikes and maintain consistent performance. In contrast, the Basic Tier lacks high availability features and is better suited for non-critical, simple caching scenarios. Memorystore for Memcached offers scalability and auto-discovery features, but it doesn't provide the same level of high availability and failover protection as the Redis Standard Tier.",

	  "questionText": "Your company is deploying a new data processing pipeline using Google Cloud Dataflow. The pipeline is developed by a specialized team of data engineers, but the ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the pipeline will be handed over to an operations team. The operations team needs to be able to monitor pipeline execution, access job logs, and restart failed jobs, but they should not have the ability to modify the pipeline's code or configuration. Which Identity and Access Management (IAM) role should be assigned to the operations team to appropriately manage the Dataflow pipeline while following Google recommended best practices?",
	  "options": [
		"A. Dataflow Developer (roles/dataflow.developer) to provide full access to create, modify, and manage Dataflow jobs.",
		"B. Dataflow Viewer (roles/dataflow.viewer) to allow viewing and monitoring of Dataflow jobs without the ability to modify them.",
		"C. Project Editor (roles/editor) to grant broad access to modify and manage resources within the project.",
		"D. Project Viewer (roles/viewer) to provide read-only access across all Google Cloud services in the project."
	  ],
	  "answerIndex": [1],
	  "explanation": "The Dataflow Viewer (roles/dataflow.viewer) IAM role is the most appropriate for the operations team in this scenario. This role allows users to view and monitor Dataflow jobs, including accessing job logs and metrics, which is essential for the team responsible for the pipeline's operation and maintenance. However, it does not grant permissions to modify the pipeline's code or configuration, aligning with the principle of least privilege and ensuring that the operations team cannot make unauthorized changes to the data processing pipeline. This role provides the necessary access for monitoring and basic operational tasks without the broader permissions that come with roles like Dataflow Developer or Editor, which would exceed the required access level for the operations team's responsibilities.",
