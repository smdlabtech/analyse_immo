The data queried is about 1 GB, and some rows are expected to change about 10 times every hour. You have optimized the SQL statements as much as possible. You want to further optimize the query's performance. What should you do?",
        "options":[
			"A. Create a materialized view based on the table, and query that view.",
			"B. Enable caching of the queried data so that subsequent queries are faster.",
			"C. Create a scheduled query, and run it a few minutes before the report has to be created.",
			"D. Reserve a larger number of slots in advance so that you have maximum compute power to execute the query."
        ],
        "answerIndex": [0],
        "Feedback": [
          "Option A. is correct because materialized views periodically cache the results of a query for increased performance. Materialized views are suited to small datasets that are frequently queried. When underlying table data changes, the materialized view invalidates the affected portions and re-reads them.",
          "Option B. is not correct because caching is automatically enabled but is not performant when the underlying data changes.",
          "Option C. is not correct because scheduled queries let you schedule recurring queries but do not provide specific performance optimizations. Also, running a query too early could use old/stale data.",
          "Option D. is not correct because reserving more slots guarantees the availability of BigQuery slots but does not improve performance."
